I downloaded the .tsv file from plasticlist.org: samples.tsv
Started a new sheet and uploaded samples.tsv
Removed columns not relevant to BPA and copied into new sheet "BPA_data"
Created subcategories of "tag category" to further refine data
  first, generated unique values for tag category
  copied Column D "tags" into a new sheet and used formula =UNIQUE(A1:A120)
  I separated the vaue of "tags" column by the delimiter "," using formula =INDEX(SPLIT(A2, ","), 1) to create subcategories
  i USED =UNIQUE(B2:B120) to generate a list of unique subcategories 
Created a table for VLOOKUP
  I copied the columns into a sheet named Categories
Added subcategories to the data in the "BPA_data" via VLOOKUP =VLOOKUP(D2, Categories!D:E, 2, FALSE)
