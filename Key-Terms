## BPA (Bisphenol A)
A chemical used in making plastics and resins—often found in food containers, water bottles, and thermal paper. It’s known to be an endocrine disruptor, meaning it can interfere with hormone function.

## TDI (Tolerable Daily Intake) – EFSA (Europe)
Defined by: European Food Safety Authority (EFSA)

Meaning: The amount of a substance (like BPA) you can ingest every day for your entire life without appreciable health risk.

BPA % TDI: The percentage of this limit a person is exposed to through a product.

Example: If the BPA % TDI is 200%, that means the exposure from the product doubles the EFSA safe daily intake.

## RfD (Reference Dose) – EPA (U.S.)
Defined by: U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

Meaning: An estimate of daily exposure to a chemical that is likely to be without risk during a lifetime.

BPA % RfD: The percentage of this EPA limit the product contributes.

Example: 150% means exposure exceeds the U.S. reference dose.

## Why Compare EFSA TDI vs. EPA RfD?
EFSA and EPA use different safety limits based on their own research and risk models.

Comparing the two gives you a clearer view of:

Which standards are stricter

Whether products exceed safety levels in Europe vs. the U.S.
